# mcdalang

**mcdalang** is a pseudo-code programming language designed to help learners write and understand core programming concepts easily.  
It is especially useful for students, educators, and beginner programmers who want to focus on logic and structure without being overwhelmed by syntax.

The project includes tools to **translate mcdalang code into several popular programming languages**, making it a great educational bridge from pseudocode to real-world languages.
